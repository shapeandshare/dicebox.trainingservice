Training Service
===============

The training service is a REST API used to request training asynchronously.

Overview
--------

**Start the service (development only):**
```
    python ./trainingservice.py
```

I've tested running the sensory service with uwsgi, and proxied through nginx.  Nginx configurations can be found within ./nginx of this repository.
```
uwsgi --http-socket 127.0.0.1:5000 --manage-script-name --mount /=trainingservice.py --plugin python,http --enable-threads --callable app â€”master
```

### Production Deployment

**Docker Container**

The recommended way to run the service is by using the official provided docker container.
The container should be deployed to a Docker Swarm as a service.

**Example**
```
docker service create \
--detach=false \
--publish 8001:80 \
--replicas 0 \
--log-driver json-file \
--name trainingservice shapeandshare/dicebox.trainingservice
```

How to apply rolling updates of the service within the swarm:
```
docker service update --image shapeandshare/dicebox.trainingservice:latest trainingservice
```

In the examples above the Docker Swarm was deployed to AWS and had the Cloudstor:aws plugin enabled and active.
The training service containers will store and read data from the shared storage.

**Global shared Cloudstor volumes mounted by all tasks in a swarm service.**

The below command is an example of how to create the shared volume within the docker swarm:
```
docker volume create -d "cloudstor:aws" --opt backing=shared dicebox
```
